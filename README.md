# WindowsPong.JS
Pong is a game from the early 1970s developed by Atari. It is to simulate table tennis, and it's played by each of two players moving a paddle across their side, and trying to hit the pong ball. If a player misses the ball, the other player gets a point, and first to eleven wins.

WindowsPong.JS is an adaptation of Pong that uses pop-up windows to play the game.

CONTROLS:
W/S: PLAYER 1, MOVEMENT
I/K: PLAYER 2, MOVEMENT
R: START/RESTART GAME
âŒ˜/Windows key: QUIT GAME

Note:  
You must have pop-ups enabled for WindowsPong.JS in your browser in order to run it.
